The _Lusitania_ had been","struck by two torpedoes in succession and was sinking rapidly, while","the boats were being launched with all possible speed. The women and","children were being lined up awaiting their turn. Some still clung","desperately to husbands and fathers; others clutched their children","closely to their breasts. One girl stood alone, slightly apart from","the rest. She was quite young, not more than eighteen. She did not seem","afraid, and her grave, steadfast eyes looked straight ahead.","","“I beg your pardon.”","","A man’s voice beside her made her start and turn. She had noticed the","speaker more than once amongst the first-class passengers. There had","been a hint of mystery about him which had appealed to her imagination.","He spoke to no one. If anyone spoke to him he was quick to rebuff the","overture. Also he had a nervous way of looking over his shoulder with a","swift, suspicious glance.","","She noticed now that he was greatly agitated. There were beads of","perspiration on his brow. He was evidently in a state of overmastering","fear. And yet he did not strike her as the kind of man who would be","afraid to meet death!","","“Yes?” Her grave eyes met his inquiringly.","","He stood looking at her with a kind of desperate irresolution.","","“It must be!” he muttered to himself. “Yes--it is the only way.” Then","aloud he said abruptly: “You are an American?”","","“Yes.”","","“A patriotic one?”","","The girl flushed.","","“I guess you’ve no right to ask such a thing! Of course I am!”","","“Don’t be offended. You wouldn’t be if you knew how much there was at","stake. But I’ve got to trust some one--and it must be a woman.”","","“Why?”","","“Because of ‘women and children first.’” He looked round and lowered his","voice. “I’m carrying papers--vitally important papers. They may make all","the difference to the Allies in the war. You understand? These papers","have _got_ to be saved! They’ve more chance with you than with me. Will","you take them?”","","The girl held out her hand.",""],"id":1}]]},"timestamp":1569354553342}
